  app functionality is for use on the terminal with node. 
  
  ## Contribution Guidelines
  If you'd like to contribute get creative! id love to see what other additions could be made (maybe some javascript to save the file somewhere other than the directory). Alternatively I always love to grow my community of coding, reach out to me via linkedin or send me an email!
  
  ## Tests
  To test app, run through instructions with some random aswers and check the directory contents for a readme file when completed, open the markdown file and voila you should see the generated content.
